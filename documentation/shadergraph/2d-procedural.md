ShaderGraph Node Group
2D-Procedural
Generate 2D gradients, noise, and other patterns programmatically for your material.
Overview
Use these nodes to generate gradients, noise, and other types of patterns and apply them to textures or other 2D surfaces. For example, you might use a horizontal or vertical ramp node to create a color gradient on a surface.
Topics
Nodes
Ramp Horizontal
A left-to-right linear value ramp (gradient) generator.
Ramp Vertical
A top-to-bottom linear value ramp (gradient) generator.
Ramp 4 Corners
A four-point linear value ramp (gradient) generator.
Split Horizontal
A left-to-right split matte, split at a specified U value.
Split Vertical
A top-to-bottom split matte, split at a specified V value.
Noise 2D
A 2D Perlin noise generator.
Cellular Noise 2D
A 2D cellular noise generator.
Worley Noise 2D
A 2D Worley noise generator.
