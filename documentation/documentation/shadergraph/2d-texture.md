# 2d-texture


[Overview](/documentation/shadergraph/2d-texture#overview)
----------------------------------------------------------

 Use these nodes to incorporate file-based textures into your material. In addition to loading textures from disk, you can use each node to customize the rendering behavior of the texture.
 

 For example, a Tiled Image node repeats the original image to fill the surface with content. In addition to loading textures, you can use the Transform 2D node to apply an affine transform to a 2D vector.
 

 Load and configure 2D texture files.
