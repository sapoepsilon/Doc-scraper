# 3d-procedural


[Overview](/documentation/shadergraph/3d-procedural#overview)
-------------------------------------------------------------

 3D Procedural nodes generate noise patterns that donâ€™t repeat along the z-axis of your model. Use the nodes to add random variations to parts of your material, such as its surface roughness. Each node produces a different type of noise pattern based on a specific algorithm.
 

 Generate 3D noise patterns programmatically for your material.
