--------------------------------------------------------

 Material nodes help you divide your graph into subsets of nodes, each with distinct inputs and outputs. A
 [`Node
  Graph`](/documentation/shadergraph/material/nodegraph)
 appears as a single node within your main graph. Editing that node hides the main graph and gives you an empty space that you can fill with additional nodes. Use that space to build a specific portion of your main graph, and use the
 [`Node
  Graph`](/documentation/shadergraph/material/nodegraph)
 to define the inputs and outputs to that separate space.
 

 Encapsulate a set of shader graph nodes into a single module.
