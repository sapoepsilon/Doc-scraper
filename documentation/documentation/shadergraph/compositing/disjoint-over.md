[Parameter Types](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/disjoint-over#Parameter-Types)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Input | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `Foreground` | Color4 |
| `Background` | Color4 |
| `Mix` | Float |

| Output | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `Out` | Color4 |

[Parameter descriptions](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/disjoint-over#Parameter-descriptions)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Foreground` 

 The
 `color4` 
 foreground input.
 `F` 
 represents the RGB component of this parameter.
 `f` 
 represents the alpha component of this parameter.
 

`Background` 

 The
 `color4` 
 background input.
 `B` 
 represents the RGB component of this parameter.
 `b` 
 represents the alpha component of this parameter.
 

`Mix` 

 The weight of the blend operation. The higher the value of
 `Mix` 
 , the more apparent the effect of the blend operation. The default value is
 `1` 
 . Values outside of the range
 `0-1` 
 produce an undefined effect outside of the nodeâ€™s intended function.
 

[Discussion](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/disjoint-over#Discussion)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Disjoint Over node performs one of two mixes based on the alpha channels of the foreground and background inputs. If
 `f+b<=1` 
 , then the RGB component of the output is
 `F+B` 
 . If
 `f+b>1` 
 , then the RGB component of the output is
 `F+b(1-f)/b` 
 . The alpha component of the output for this node is always the smaller value between
 `f+b` 
 or 1. Below is a simple node graph that uses the Disjoint Over node to blend a tile and rock texture.

 The graph remaps the alpha of the rock texture from a range of
 `0-1` 
 to a range of
 `-1-2` 
 in order to show more of the effect of both possible modes of the blend. Below are the two original images and their resulting blended texture applied to a cube.

 Blended texture
 

 A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.

### [Nodes](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/disjoint-over#nodes)

[`Premultiply`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/premultiply)

 Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
 

[`Unpremultiply`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/unpremultiply)

 Divides the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
 

[`Additive Mix`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/additive-mix)

 Adds foreground and background values.
 

[`Subtractive Mix`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/subtractive-mix)

 Subtracts foreground from background values.
 

[`Difference`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/difference)

 Outputs the distance between foreground and background values.
 

[`Burn`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/burn)

 A blend operation that darkens the foreground layer using the background.
 

[`Dodge`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/dodge)

 A blend operation that lightens the background layer depending on the foreground.
 

[`Screen`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/screen)

 A blend operation that lightens areas that are darker than white.
 

[`Overlay`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/overlay)

 A blend operation that multiplies dark areas and screens light areas.
 

[`In`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/in)

 Outputs areas of foreground that overlap with the alpha of background.
 

[`Mask`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/mask)

 Outputs areas of background that overlap with the alpha of foreground.
 

[`Matte`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/matte)

 A merge operation that layers premultiplied foreground over background.
 

[`Out`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/out)

 Outputs areas of foreground that do not overlap with background.
 

[`Over`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/over)

 A merge operation that layers foreground over background, using the alpha of the foreground.
 

[`Inside`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/inside)

 Multiplies a mask to all channels of the input.
 

[`Outside`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/outside)

 Multiplies (1 - mask) to all channels of the input.
 

[`Mix`](/documentation/shadergraph/compositing/mix)

 Mixes foreground and background inputs, weighting based on mix value.
