[Parameter descriptions](/documentation/shadergraph/data/swizzle#Parameter-descriptions)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`In` 

 The input value
 

`Channels` 

 A string of
 `1-4` 
 characters that determine the permutation to perform. These characters can be “r”, “g”, “b”, or “a” if the
 `In` 
 parameter is a color input, or “x”, “y”, “z”, or “w” for vector inputs. Use “r” or “x” if the input is a float.
 

[Discussion](/documentation/shadergraph/data/swizzle#Discussion)
----------------------------------------------------------------

 The Swizzle node determines its output by first looking at the
 `Channels` 
 parameter. Each character in the
 `Channel` 
 string represents one of the channels of the
 `In` 
 parameter. For example, if you pass in a vector3 of
 `(1, 5, 10)` 
 as the
 `In` 
 parameter, “x” refers to
 `1` 
 , “y” to
 `5` 
 , and “z” to
 `10` 
 . The order of the characters determines how the channels of the input switch around to create the output. For the previous example, if the
 `Channels` 
 parameter is “zzz”, the output is
 `(10, 10, 10)` 
 .
 

 Note
 

 The number of characters in the
 `Channels` 
 must be equal to the number of channels in the output.
 

 The table below shows additional examples of the swizzle node process.
 

| In | Channels | Out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vector3: (1, 5, 10) | zzz | Vector3: (10, 10, 10) |
| Vector3: (1, 5, 10) | zyx | Vector3: (10, 5, 1) |
| Vector2: (5, 0) | xxy | Vector3: (5, 5, 0) |
| Vector3: (1, 5, 10) | zx | Vector2: (10, 1) |
| Color3: (0.5, 0.8, 0) | grb | Color3: (0.8, 0.5, 0) |

 Performs an arbitrary permutation of the channels of the input stream, returning a new stream of the specified type.
