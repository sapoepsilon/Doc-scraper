ShaderGraph Node Group
Adjustment
Modify or convert values, or ranges of values, from one form to another.
Overview
Use Adjustment nodes to adjust color values, convert between different color formats, or map input values to a different set of outputs based on rules you specify. For example, you might use these nodes to adapt the output from one node to match the expected input for another node.
Topics
Nodes
Remap
Linearly remaps incoming values from one range to another.
Smooth Step
Outputs a smooth remapping from low-high to 0-1.
Luminance
Outputs a grayscale value containing the luminance of the incoming RGB color in all color channels.
RGB to HSV
Converts a color from RGB to HSV space.
HSV to RGB
Converts a color from HSV to RGB space.
Contrast
Increases or decreases contrast of values using a linear slope multiplier.
Range
Remaps incoming values from one range to another.
HSV Adjust
Adjusts the hue, saturation and value of an RGB color by a vector .
Saturate
Adjusts the saturation of a color.
Step (Reality
Kit)
Outputs a 1 or a 0 depending on whether the input is greater than or less than the edge value.
