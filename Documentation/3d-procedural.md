ShaderGraph Node Group
3D-Procedural
Generate 3D noise patterns programmatically for your material.
Overview
3D Procedural nodes generate noise patterns that donâ€™t repeat along the z-axis of your model. Use the nodes to add random variations to parts of your material, such as its surface roughness. Each node produces a different type of noise pattern based on a specific algorithm.
Topics
Nodes
Noise 3D
A 3D Perlin noise generator.
Fractal Noise 3D
Zero-centered 3D fractal noise created by summing several octaves of 3D Perlin noise.
Cellular Noise 3D
A 3D cellular noise generator.
Worley Noise 3D
A 3D Worley noise generator.
