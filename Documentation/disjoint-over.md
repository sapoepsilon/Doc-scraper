ShaderGraph Node
Disjoint Over
A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.

Parameter descriptions
Foreground
The 
color4
 foreground input. 
F
 represents the RGB component of this parameter. 
f
 represents the alpha component of this parameter.
Background
The 
color4
 background input. 
B
 represents the RGB component of this parameter. 
b
represents the alpha component of this parameter.
Mix
The weight of the blend operation. The higher the value of 
Mix
, the more apparent the effect of the blend operation. The default value is 
1
. Values outside of the range 
0-1
 produce an undefined effect outside of the node’s intended function.
Discussion
The Disjoint Over node performs one of two mixes based on the alpha channels of the foreground and background inputs. If 
f+b<=1
, then the RGB component of the output is 
F+B
. If 
f+b>1
, then the RGB component of the output is 
F+b(1-f)/b
. The alpha component of the output for this node is always the smaller value between 
f+b
 or 1. Below is a simple node graph that uses the Disjoint Over node to blend a tile and rock texture.
The graph remaps the alpha of the rock texture from a range of 
0-1
 to a range of 
-1-2
 in order to show more of the effect of both possible modes of the blend. Below are the two original images and their resulting blended texture applied to a cube.

Nodes
Premultiply
Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
Unpremultiply
Divides the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
Additive Mix
Adds foreground and background values.
Subtractive Mix
Subtracts foreground from background values.
Difference
Outputs the distance between foreground and background values.
Burn
A blend operation that darkens the foreground layer using the background.
Dodge
A blend operation that lightens the background layer depending on the foreground.
Screen
A blend operation that lightens areas that are darker than white.
Overlay
A blend operation that multiplies dark areas and screens light areas.
In
Outputs areas of foreground that overlap with the alpha of background.
Mask
Outputs areas of background that overlap with the alpha of foreground.
Matte
A merge operation that layers premultiplied foreground over background.
Out
Outputs areas of foreground that do not overlap with background.
Over
A merge operation that layers foreground over background, using the alpha of the foreground.
Inside
Multiplies a mask to all channels of the input.
Outside
Multiplies (1 - mask) to all channels of the input.
Mix
Mixes foreground and background inputs, weighting based on mix value.
