Parameter descriptions
In
The input color the node adjusts.
Amount
The adjustment of the HSV. The default value is 
(0,1,1)
, which causes no change.
Discussion
The HSV Adjust node adjusts the hue, saturation, and value of the color passed to the 
In
 parameter. The node performs this adjustment by adding the first value of the 
Amount
 vector to the hue, multiplying the saturation by the second value of the 
Amount
 vector, and multiplying that value by the third value of the 
Amount
 vector. When adjusting the hue, a positive value rotates the hue in the direction of red to green to blue. A value of 1 represents an entire rotation, and results in no change.
Note
This node never changes the alpha of a 
color4
.
