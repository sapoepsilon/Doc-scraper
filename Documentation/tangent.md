Parameter descriptions
Space
The space in which the shader defines the bitangent vector. Defaults to 
object
.
Index
The index of the texture coordinates that the node computes the tangent against. Default is 
0
.
Discussion
Valid values for the 
Space
 parameter include the following:
model
: The local coordinate space before the shader applies any local deformations or global transforms to the geometry.
object
: The local coordinate space after the shader applies local deformations but before it applies global transforms to the geometry.
world
: The global coordinate space after the shader applies both local deformations and global transforms to the geometry.
