ShaderGraph Node Group
2D-Texture
Load and configure 2D texture files.
Overview
Use these nodes to incorporate file-based textures into your material. In addition to loading textures from disk, you can use each node to customize the rendering behavior of the texture.
For example, a Tiled Image node repeats the original image to fill the surface with content. In addition to loading textures, you can use the Transform 2D node to apply an affine transform to a 2D vector.
Topics
Nodes
Image
A texture referencing a 2D image file.
Tiled Image
Samples data from an image with provisions for offsetting and tiling in UV space.
UV Texture
A MaterialX version of USD UV Texture reader.
Transform 2D
A node that applies an affine transformation to a 2d input.
