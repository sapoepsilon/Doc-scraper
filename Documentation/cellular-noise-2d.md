Parameter descriptions
Texture Coordinates
The 2D coordinate at which the data is read in order to map the texture onto a surface. The default is to use the current 
UV
 coordinates, in which 
U
 is the horizontal axis and 
V
 is the vertical axis.
Discussion
The Cellular Noise 2D shader node procedurally generates noise patterns that can be used to add texture and variation to materials. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the Cellular Noise 2D Node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally.
Multiply the incoming texture coordinates with a constant float. The float changes the frequency of the generated noise to a higher number that corresponds with the pattern repeating more often. The output of the node runs through a convert node in order to change the float output to a black and white color output. Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube.
