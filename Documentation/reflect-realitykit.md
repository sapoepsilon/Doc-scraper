Parameter descriptions
In
The input vector to be reflected.
Normal
The vector that the 
In
 vector will be reflected with reference to.
Discussion
The Reflect node reflects the 
In
 vector by taking into account the surface orientation determined by the 
Normal
 vector. The Reflect node first normalizes the 
Normal
 vector and then calculates the reflection direction using the formula 
In - 2 * dot(Normal, In) * Normal
. In this equation, 
dot()
 represents the dot product of the two vectors.
