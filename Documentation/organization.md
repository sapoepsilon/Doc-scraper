ShaderGraph Node Group
Organization
Modify the visual flow of data within your graph without changing any values.
Overview
Use organization nodes to manage the visual complexity of your graph. Place a 
Dot
 node between two other nodes, and use the node to reroute connection lines around other nodes and elements. Dot nodes pass the data on their input side directly to the output side without modification.
Topics
Nodes
Dot
A pass-through node used for visually routing edges in the graph.
