ShaderGraph Node Group
Logic
Perform Boolean operations and other logical comparisons on data values.
Overview
Use Logic nodes to facilitate decision trees and other logic-based choices within your graph. You can perform comparisons for equality or to determine if one value is larger than another. You can also perform logic operations on Boolean values.
Topics
Nodes
If Greater
Outputs True Result or False Result depending on whether value1 > value2.
If Greater Or Equal
Outputs True Result or False Result depending on whether value1 >= value2.
If Equal
Outputs True Result or False Result depending on whether value1 == value2.
Switch
Outputs the value from one of ten input streams, according to a selector .
And (Reality
Kit)
Boolean operation in1 && in2.
Or (Reality
Kit)
Boolean operation in1 || in2.
XOR (Reality
Kit)
Returns true if only one of the inputs is true.
Not (Reality
Kit)
Returns !input.
