Parameter description
Texture Coordinates
The 2D coordinate at which the data is read in order to map the texture onto a surface. The default uses the current 
UV
 coordinates, in which 
U
 is the horizontal axis and 
V
 is the vertical axis.
Jitter
The amount to 
jitter
 or shift the center of each cell experiences. The default value is 
1
.0
. A smaller value creates a more regular pattern, and 
0
 creates perfect squares.
Discussion
The Worley Noise 2D node procedurally generates nonuniform cellular regions. A finite number of center points are created, and each region is a polygon that surrounds the points closest to each center point. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the Worley Noise 2D Node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally.
Multiply the incoming texture coordinates with a constant float, which changes the frequency of the generated noise. A higher value coresponds to the pattern repeating more often. You then run the output through a convert node to change it to a black and white color value.
Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube.
