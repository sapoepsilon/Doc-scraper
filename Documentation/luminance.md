Parameter descriptions
In
The input to convert to grayscale.
Luma Coefficients
The luma coefficients of the color space. The possible values for this node are the luma coeffiecients for the color spaces 
acescg
, 
rec202/rec2100
, or 
rec709
. The default value is the luma coeffiecients for 
acescg
, which are 
(0
.2722287, 0
.6740818, 0
.0536895)
.
Discussion
The Luminance node takes in a color input and outputs that input as a grayscale image. The node computes the grayscale of an image by taking the dot product of the luma coefficients and the color vector. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the luminance node to convert an image to grayscale.
Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube.
