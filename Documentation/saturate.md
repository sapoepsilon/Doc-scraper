Parameter descriptions
In
The input color to adjust the saturation of.
Amount
The multiplier to apply to the saturation. The default value is 
1
.0
.
Luma Coefficients
The luma coefficients of the color space. The possible values for this node are the luma coeffiecients for the color spaces 
acescg
, 
rec202/rec2100
, or 
rec709
. The default value is the luma coeffiecients for 
acescg
, which are 
(0
.2722287, 0
.6740818, 0
.0536895)
.
Discussion
The Saturate node performs a linear interpolation between the incoming color value and the luminance of the incoming color value. Setting the value of the 
Amount
 parameter to 
0
 adjusts the output to a grayscale of the input equal to the value that the 
Luminance
 would output.
Note
The effect of this node isnâ€™t equivalent to adjusting saturation with the 
HSV Adjust
 node. The Saturate node takes into account a colorspace when processing its modifications.
Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the Saturate node to modify the saturation of an image.
Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube.

Nodes
Remap
Linearly remaps incoming values from one range to another.
Smooth Step
Outputs a smooth remapping from low-high to 0-1.
Luminance
Outputs a grayscale value containing the luminance of the incoming RGB color in all color channels.
RGB to HSV
Converts a color from RGB to HSV space.
HSV to RGB
Converts a color from HSV to RGB space.
Contrast
Increases or decreases contrast of values using a linear slope multiplier.
Range
Remaps incoming values from one range to another.
HSV Adjust
Adjusts the hue, saturation and value of an RGB color by a vector .
Step (Reality
Kit)
Outputs a 1 or a 0 depending on whether the input is greater than or less than the edge value.
