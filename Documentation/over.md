Parameter descriptions
Foreground
The 
color4
 foreground input. 
F
 represents the RGB component of this parameter. 
f
 represents the alpha component of this parameter.
Background
The 
color4
 background input. 
B
 represents the RGB component of this parameter. 
b
represents the alpha component of this parameter.
Mix
The weight of the blend operation. The higher the value of 
Mix
, the more apparent the effect of the blend operation. The default value is 
1
. Values outside of the range 
0-1
 produce an undefined effect outside of the nodeâ€™s intended function.
Discussion
The Over node determines its output using the alpha channels of the foreground and background inputs. The RGB component of the output is 
F+B(1-f)
 and the alpha component of the output is 
f+b(1-f)
. The lower the alpha of the foreground, the more the background blends into the foreground. Below is a simple node graph that uses the Over node to blend a wood and rock texture.
Below are the two original images, the image representation of the alpha of the foreground, and the resulting blended texture applied to a cube.

Nodes
Premultiply
Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
Unpremultiply
Divides the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
Additive Mix
Adds foreground and background values.
Subtractive Mix
Subtracts foreground from background values.
Difference
Outputs the distance between foreground and background values.
Burn
A blend operation that darkens the foreground layer using the background.
Dodge
A blend operation that lightens the background layer depending on the foreground.
Screen
A blend operation that lightens areas that are darker than white.
Overlay
A blend operation that multiplies dark areas and screens light areas.
Disjoint Over
A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.
In
Outputs areas of foreground that overlap with the alpha of background.
Mask
Outputs areas of background that overlap with the alpha of foreground.
Matte
A merge operation that layers premultiplied foreground over background.
Out
Outputs areas of foreground that do not overlap with background.
Inside
Multiplies a mask to all channels of the input.
Outside
Multiplies (1 - mask) to all channels of the input.
Mix
Mixes foreground and background inputs, weighting based on mix value.
