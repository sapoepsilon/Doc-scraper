Parameter descriptions
Foreground
The foreground input. Represented by 
F
 in the mathmatical equation.
Background
The background input. Represented by 
B
 in the mathmatical equation.
Mix
The weight of the blend effect. The higher the 
Mix
, the greater the intensity of the blend operation, and the more the effect is visually apparent. The default value is 
1
. Values outside of the range 
0-1
 produce an undefined effect outside of the nodeâ€™s intended function.
Discussion
The Subtractive Mix node subtracts two inputs and uses the 
Mix
 input to determine the weight of the foreground in the blend, represented by the equation 
B - F
. Higher values closer to 
1
 output a more intense subtractive mix, while lower values closer to 
0
 dim the effect. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the subtractive mix node to blend two images together into a single material.
Below are two images and the resulting blended texture applied to a cube.

Nodes
Premultiply
Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
Unpremultiply
Divides the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
Additive Mix
Adds foreground and background values.
Difference
Outputs the distance between foreground and background values.
Burn
A blend operation that darkens the foreground layer using the background.
Dodge
A blend operation that lightens the background layer depending on the foreground.
Screen
A blend operation that lightens areas that are darker than white.
Overlay
A blend operation that multiplies dark areas and screens light areas.
Disjoint Over
A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.
In
Outputs areas of foreground that overlap with the alpha of background.
Mask
Outputs areas of background that overlap with the alpha of foreground.
Matte
A merge operation that layers premultiplied foreground over background.
Out
Outputs areas of foreground that do not overlap with background.
Over
A merge operation that layers foreground over background, using the alpha of the foreground.
Inside
Multiplies a mask to all channels of the input.
Outside
Multiplies (1 - mask) to all channels of the input.
Mix
Mixes foreground and background inputs, weighting based on mix value.
