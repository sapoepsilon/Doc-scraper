Parameter descriptions
Foreground
The foreground input.
Background
The background input.
Mix
The weight that determines what the output value is closer to. The default value is 
0
. Values outside of the range 
0-1
 produce an undefined effect outside of the nodeâ€™s intended function.
Discussion
The Mix node blends two input values together, represented by the equation 
F * m + B(1 - m)
.  If the 
Mix
 value is 
1
, the output is identical to the 
Foreground
 value. If the value is 
0
, the output is identical to the 
Background
 value. The closer the 
Mix
 value is to 
0
 or 
1
, the closer the output will be to the corresponding input. Use the Mix node to blend between two different textures and create transtions or effects, interpolate between two colors, or mix shader parameters. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the Mix node to blend two images together into a single material.
Below are the original two images and the resulting mixed texture applied to a cube with 
Mix
 values of 
0
.1
, 
0
.5
, and 
0
.9
.
Foreground
Background
Mix value of 0.1
Mix value of 0.5
Mix value of 0.9

Nodes
Premultiply
Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
Unpremultiply
Divides the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
Additive Mix
Adds foreground and background values.
Subtractive Mix
Subtracts foreground from background values.
Difference
Outputs the distance between foreground and background values.
Burn
A blend operation that darkens the foreground layer using the background.
Dodge
A blend operation that lightens the background layer depending on the foreground.
Screen
A blend operation that lightens areas that are darker than white.
Overlay
A blend operation that multiplies dark areas and screens light areas.
Disjoint Over
A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.
In
Outputs areas of foreground that overlap with the alpha of background.
Mask
Outputs areas of background that overlap with the alpha of foreground.
Matte
A merge operation that layers premultiplied foreground over background.
Out
Outputs areas of foreground that do not overlap with background.
Over
A merge operation that layers foreground over background, using the alpha of the foreground.
Inside
Multiplies a mask to all channels of the input.
Outside
Multiplies (1 - mask) to all channels of the input.
