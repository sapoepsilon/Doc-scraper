ShaderGraph Node
Refract (Reality
Kit)
Refracts a vector using a given normal and index of refraction (eta).

Parameter descriptions
In
The vector to refract.
Normal
The normal of the surface from which the 
In
 vector refracts.
Eta
The index of refraction.
Discussion
The Refract node takes an incident vector 
In
 and calculates the direction of refraction off a surface.
Note
The vectors passed as the 
In
 and 
Normal
 parameters must both already be normalized in order to get the desired output.
