Parameter descriptions
Position
The 3D coordinates at which the node reads the data in order to map the texture onto a surface. The default uses the current 3D object-space coordinates.
Jitter
The amount of 
jitter
 or shift the center of each cell experiences. The default value is 
1
.0
. A smaller value creates a more regular pattern, and 
0
 creates perfect squares.
Discussion
The Worley Noise 3D node procedurally generates nonuniform cellular regions. The node creates a finite number of center points, and each region is a polygon that surrounds the points closest to each center point. Because this node generates noise in 3D, the texture doesn’t repeat in the Z direction but rather continues as depth changes. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the Worley Noise 3D node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally.
Multiply the incoming texture coordinates with a constant float, which changes the frequency of the generated noise. A higher value corresponds to the pattern repeating more often. Then run the output through a convert node to change it to a black and white color value.
Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube.
