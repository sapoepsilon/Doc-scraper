ShaderGraph Node Group
Application
Get system values such as the current time or the direction of the up vector.
Overview
Use Application nodes as input to other parts of your material. For example, you might use the current time as a unique input value to another node.
Topics
Nodes
Time (float)
The current time in seconds.
Up Direction
The direction of the up vector.
