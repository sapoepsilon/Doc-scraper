Parameter descriptions
In
The input color to adjust the saturation of.
Amount
The multiplier to apply to the saturation. The default value is 
1
.0
.
Luma Coefficients
The luma coefficients of the color space. The possible values for this node are the luma coeffiecients for the color spaces 
acescg
, 
rec202/rec2100
, or 
rec709
. The default value is the luma coeffiecients for 
acescg
, which are 
(0
.2722287, 0
.6740818, 0
.0536895)
.
Discussion
The Saturate node performs a linear interpolation between the incoming color value and the luminance of the incoming color value. Setting the value of the 
Amount
 parameter to 
0
 adjusts the output to a grayscale of the input equal to the value that the 
Luminance
 would output.
Note
The effect of this node isn’t equivalent to adjusting saturation with the 
HSV Adjust
 node. The Saturate node takes into account a colorspace when processing its modifications.
Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the Saturate node to modify the saturation of an image.
Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube.

Nodes
Remap
Linearly remaps incoming values from one range to another.
Smooth Step
Outputs a smooth remapping from low-high to 0-1.
Luminance
Outputs a grayscale value containing the luminance of the incoming RGB color in all color channels.
RGB to HSV
Converts a color from RGB to HSV space.
HSV to RGB
Converts a color from HSV to RGB space.
Contrast
Increases or decreases contrast of values using a linear slope multiplier.
Range
Remaps incoming values from one range to another.
HSV Adjust
Adjusts the hue, saturation and value of an RGB color by a vector .
Step (Reality
Kit)
Outputs a 1 or a 0 depending on whether the input is greater than or less than the edge value.
